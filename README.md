#  Yelp Api Restaurant- Restaurant Finder App

## Introduction

Welcome to "YOUR_NAME Yelp," a restaurant finder application that allows you to discover and explore various restaurants based on your preferences. This app utilizes the Yelp Fusion API to fetch accurate and up-to-date information about restaurants, including their names, addresses, ratings, reviews, and more.

## Features

1. **Restaurant List**: When you launch the app for the first time, you will see a list of default restaurants. You can choose your preferred restaurant based on your taste and location.

2. **Search Functionality**: The app allows you to search for restaurants by name, location, or cuisine type. Simply enter your query in the search bar, and the app will display relevant results.

3. **Sorting Options**: You can sort the search results based on the following criteria:
   - **Rating**: Restaurants will be ordered from the highest rating to the lowest rating. If rating information is unavailable, the restaurant will be placed at the bottom of the list.
   - **Price**: Restaurants will be ordered from the cheapest to the most expensive. If price information is unavailable, the restaurant will be placed at the top of the list.

4. **Restaurant Details**: Clicking on a restaurant item in the search results will display detailed information about the selected restaurant, including its address, contact details, reviews, and rating.

5. **Add to Favorites**: You can add a restaurant to your favorites list by clicking on the restaurant item and confirming the action in the displayed dialog. The favorite restaurants will be stored in the app's database for persistence across application restarts.

6. **Favorites Section**: To access your favorite restaurants, swipe right on the screen to open the navigation drawer and choose the "Favorites" option. The navigation drawer will also include a header displaying the application's name.
